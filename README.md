The Windows App Development CLI is a single command-line interface for managing Windows SDKs, packaging, generating app identity, manifests, certificates, and using build tools with any app framework. This tool bridges the gap between cross-platform development and Windows-native capabilities.
<br/><br/>
Whether you're building with Electron, .NET/Win32, CMake, or Python, this CLI gives you access to:

- **Modern Windows APIs** - [Windows App SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/) and Windows SDK with automatic setup and code generation
- **App Identity** - Debug and test by adding app identity without full packaging in a snap
- **MSIX Packaging** - App packaging with signing and Store readiness
- **Developer Tools** - Manifests, certificates, assets, and build integration

Perfect for:

- **Electron/cross-platform developers** wanting native Windows features or targeting Windows
- **Developers testing and deploying** adding app identity for development or packaging for deployment
- **CI/CD pipelines** automating Windows app builds

## 📦 Installation

### WinGet

![WinGet Package Version](https://img.shields.io/winget/v/Microsoft.WinAppCli)

The easiest way to use the CLI is via WinGet (Windows Package Manager). In Terminal, simply run:

`winget install Microsoft.WinAppCli`

### NPM

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40microsoft%2Fwinappcli)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/winappcli)


You can install the CLI for Electron projects via NPM:

`npm install @microsoft/winappcli --save-dev`

### Download Release Manually

Or, download the latest build from GitHub Releases:

**[👉 Download Latest Build](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/releases/latest)**

**Available Options:**

| Package | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **`winappcli_[version]_[platform].msix`** | 📦 MSIX Installer | Easy to install, automatically added to path, great for general usage |
| **`winappcli-[version]-[platform].zip`** | 📦 Standalone Binaries | Portable, no install needed - great for CI/CD |
| **`microsoft-winappcli-[version].tgz`** | 📚 NPM Package | For Node.js/Electron projects |

## Get started

Checkout our getting started guides for step by step instructions:
- [Electron guide](/docs/electron-get-started.md): step by step guide of using the Phi Silica APIs in a new Electron application with a C# addon, debugging with identity, and MSIX packaging.

## 📋 Usage

Once installed (see [Installation](#-installation) above), verify the installation by calling the CLI:

```bash
winapp --help
```

or if using Electron/Node.js

```bash
npx winapp --help
```

### Commands Overview

**Setup Commands:**

- [`init`](./docs/usage.md#init) - Initialize project with Windows SDK and App SDK
- [`restore`](./docs/usage.md#restore) - Restore packages and dependencies
- [`update`](./docs/usage.md#update) - Update packages and dependencies to latest versions

**App Identity & Debugging:**

- [`package`](./docs/usage.md#package) - Create MSIX packages from directories
- [`create-debug-identity`](./docs/usage.md#create-debug-identity) - Add temporary app identity for debugging
- [`manifest`](./docs/usage.md#manifest) - Generate and manage AppxManifest.xml files

**Certificates & Signing:**

- [`cert`](./docs/usage.md#cert) - Generate and install development certificates
- [`sign`](./docs/usage.md#sign) - Sign MSIX packages and executables

**Development Tools:**

- [`tool`](./docs/usage.md#tool) - Access Windows SDK tools
- [`get-winapp-path`](./docs/usage.md#get-winapp-path) - Get paths to installed SDK components

**Node.js/Electron Specific:**

## 🔧 Feedback

- [File an issue, feature request or bug](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/issues): please ensure that you are not filing a duplicate issue
- Send feedback to <windowsdevelopertoolkit@microsoft.com>: Do you love this tool? Are there features or fixes you want to see? Let us know!

We are actively working on improving Node and Python support. These features are experimental and we are aware of several issues with these app types.

## 🧪 Try the Windows Identity App

This repository also contains an **experimental** app (GUI) that wraps the CLI and provides an intuitive, drag-and-drop experience. [See the docs](/docs/gui-usage.md) for more details. [Download the app here](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/releases/tag/v0.1.1-gui).

## 🧾 Samples

This repository will continue to be added with samples. Currently the following samples exist:

- [Electron sample](/samples/electron/README.md): a default Electron Forge generated application + initialized a winapp project with appxmanifest, assets + native addon + C# addon + generates cert
